## ðŸš² About this project (please read!)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a6d6a581-2a28-4361-8019-bf49a8725d10/deploy-status)](https://genuine-strudel-a580d7.netlify.app/)

My task for this project is to build a full-stack application with any of the technologies of my choice that I've learned in this cohort and creating any application that I would like. So, please let me introduce you the next generation website you need next time you bike in new york city - BIKE NYC.

Build with the latest version of React and Django. **_BIKE - NYC_** is a simple and easy-to-use website that let you find different biking trails and parks in NYC for the best biking experience you could possibly think of. You can add and share your favorite trails, add photos to it and edit others to make them even better! Bike-NYC also provide you bike recommandations for you to purchace in the future if you are a true enthusiast, and rental options for you even if you are just visiting for a short time.
