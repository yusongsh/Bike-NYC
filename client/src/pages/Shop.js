                  riding simply to ride, riding for the love of riding, is just
                  what we need. And this is what the Aethos lives for. Sure,
                  it‚Äôs given nothing up to performance, and happens to be the
                  lightest frame out there, but with no compromise to style‚Ä¶

                  The 4130 Steel Line earned its namesake from the double-butted

                  maximizes strength without making compromises on weight. Now
                  with completely redesigned geometry to accommodate larger tire
                  clearance and equipped with fork and seat stay rack mounts to
                  be the perfect all-rounder.
